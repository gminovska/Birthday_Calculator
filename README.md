# Birthday_Calculator
This is the first assignment in Steve Conger's .NET Programming Class (ITC172) at Seattle Central.(Spring 2016)
It is an introduction to ASP.NET. It displays a name input field and a calendar from which he user selecs the birthdate. 
The application then returns the user's name and the days left until the next B-day.

The solution provided previously was using a Math.Abs function to avoid negative numbers.
However that causes inaaccurate results. 

I modified the exercise done in class by adding a method that disables the past dates from being selected,
which solves the problem of negative number output.
